    <h1>
        TL;DR
    </h1>
    <p>We (self.note) store your data, i.e. the data you sumbit by creating notes. We also prompt you to enter your
        email address for storing your private notes - however, the email address is used only for the purpose of
        authentication, as we identify private notes by a fingerprint based on your email address. Anyway, that is all
        the information that we store in our databases. We will not share that information with anyone, unless required
        or obliged by law.</p>
